## Automatic run identity — never ask the organiser or user

Resolve the run metadata yourself before creating files. Do not ask the user or organiser for model, date, version, category, project title or creative direction.

1. **MODEL_SLUG:** Identify the model actually executing this prompt from the active system/runtime model identifier. Prefer the exact identifier including its variant; otherwise use the public model name exposed by the environment. If provider-qualified, keep the model portion after the final slash. Lowercase it, replace spaces, underscores and other non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens, retain letters, digits, dots and hyphens, collapse repeated hyphens and trim punctuation. Never invent a model identity. If no identity is exposed, use `unknown-model` and disclose that in metadata notes.
2. **RUN_DATE:** Use the current calendar date supplied by system/runtime context in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. If unavailable, use the current UTC date from the runtime. Never use the prompt edit date or a file timestamp.
3. **VERSION:** Always use the integer `1`. Never ask, infer, increment or substitute another value.

Use the resolved values in both the output folder and `meta.json`. Do not pause for confirmation and do not leave placeholders in the finished files.

## The challenge

Invent a business, product or organisation and build its website as if your studio were being paid to launch it. You choose the category, audience, positioning, name, offer, pricing model and voice. The site has to make a stranger understand the offer in ten seconds, believe it in sixty, and know exactly what to do next.

Nothing may be decorative filler: every section must earn its place in the argument the page is making.

## Build at the ceiling — design for the best result you are capable of

This is a benchmark, not a sprint for a small phone. Your primary canvas is a large, high-quality display: 1440-2560px wide, pointer and keyboard, a viewer with time and attention. Design the experience you would want to be judged on at that size, then make it hold together as the screen shrinks.

- Make the big screen sing: real composition, layered depth, confident typographic scale, motion that earns its place, and detail that rewards looking closely at 100% zoom.
- Do not optimise for the smallest possible payload or the lowest common denominator. Optimise for the best experience you can actually build and verify.
- Keyboard and pointer are first-class: shortcuts, hover and focus-visible states, precise input, real density.
- Responsive is a quality bar, not the design driver. Layouts must reflow cleanly at tablet and phone widths, touch targets must stay usable and nothing may overflow or clip — but the large-screen experience is the one you are showing off.
- Ambition that stutters is not ambition: keep interaction immediate and animation smooth on ordinary hardware, respect reduced motion, and hold WCAG AA contrast throughout.

## The bar

- A distinct brand identity expressed in code: wordmark or logotype, palette, type pairing, spacing system, image language, motion. It should be recognisable with the logo removed.
- At least five purposeful sections that build a case — for example an opening statement, the offer, proof, how it works, who is behind it, objections answered, and a closing action — in an order that makes sense for the specific business, not the generic template order.
- Real copy, written with a specific voice, at least several hundred words in total. Named products, prices, service details, policies, testimonials that read like they came from actual customers, FAQ answers that resolve real doubts.
- A working enquiry or booking flow: validation with specific, human error messages, a genuine success state, a clear recovery path, and no data lost when something goes wrong. Handled entirely in the browser.
- SEO-ready structure: descriptive title and meta description, one H1, semantic sections, descriptive link text, social preview tags, and structured data that matches what the page actually claims.
- Craft in the details: scroll-triggered reveals that respect reduced motion, considered hover and focus states, responsive imagery that never distorts, empty and error states written in the brand's voice.

## Creative freedom — the concept is yours

We are scoring execution, not obedience. Choose the subject, the people, the tone, the structure, the visual language and the implementation yourself. Do not ask questions, do not offer a menu of options, do not wait for approval: commit to one strong direction and carry it all the way through.

Then avoid anything that smells templated: no stock hero-plus-three-cards landing page, no framework demo aesthetic, no lorem ipsum, no "your text here", no fake logos in a trust bar, no icon soup. Have a point of view, and hold it consistently across every screen, state and error message.

## Use the maximum of your resources

Use the full capability of your environment, not a fraction of it. You have a serious budget of time, steps, context and tools; spend it on the artifact. The benchmark rewards the best thing you can produce, not the fastest or the smallest.

- Work at full scale: complete content, complete systems, complete polish. Not a vertical slice, not a prototype with the interesting part postponed.
- Use every tool you actually have — file writes, shell, local server, browser automation and screenshots, devtools and console, linters, type checkers and test runners, image/audio/video generation, shader tooling, font and asset pipelines, performance profiling. If it exists in your environment, it is fair game and it is expected.
- Generate your own assets instead of settling for placeholders: procedural textures, SVG illustration, custom shaders, synthesised audio, rendered frames, composited video.
- Be ambitious with content as well as code: more written material, more authored cases, more levels, more states, more edge cases handled properly.
- Iterate like a studio: build it, look at it in a real browser, write down what is weakest, fix the weakest thing first, repeat until what remains is something you would defend out loud.
- Never truncate or abbreviate: no stubs, no "rest unchanged", no TODOs, no half-built features left in the shipped folder.

Verify, fix, re-verify. Report only what you actually observed; if a capability was unavailable, say so plainly in the `meta.json` notes instead of implying a test you did not run.

## Acceptance — a reviewer will check

1. One folder, `index.html` opens cold, no server, no console errors.
2. At least five sections with real commercial content, no filler.
3. The enquiry/booking flow validates, succeeds and fails gracefully.
4. 1440px is the good one, and 768px and 390px both hold without breaking or clipping.
5. Keyboard-only path through navigation and the main flow.
6. The page would survive a real customer reading it sceptically.

## Technical and delivery expectations

- One browser-first project that runs from `index.html` on static hosting — no server, build step, secret key, paid API, external account or manual setup for the core experience.
- Self-contained and portable: local assets, relative paths, works from a repository subfolder and, where the browser allows, from `file://`.
- No placeholder content, dead controls, fake interactions or console errors. Every visible control produces a real outcome.
- Accessible by default: semantic landmarks, labelled controls, visible focus, a keyboard path through every flow, reduced-motion support, and colour that never carries meaning alone.
- Performance is craft: profile the build, keep interaction immediate and animation smooth on an ordinary laptop, and be able to say what budget you held.
- Robust under abuse: empty data, huge data, rapid input, interrupted storage, resized window, backgrounded tab, lost connection. Guard storage access with `try/catch` and never lose the user's work silently.
- Test the actual experience in a browser when available. Otherwise do a careful code-level smoke check and disclose the limitation honestly. Never claim a test you did not run.

## Submission contract — mandatory

Create exactly one folder at the workspace root named:

**site-brand__MODEL_SLUG__RUN_DATE__v1**

Replace the model and date tokens using the rules above. The suffix is always `v1`.

At the folder root include **index.html** and **meta.json**. Include local source files and an `assets/` directory only when required by the finished project. Keep everything for this single project inside that folder.

Do not create alternate concepts, multiple versions, additional HTML entry points, README/audit files, screenshots, dependency folders, package files or build output. Do not create files outside the project folder. Do not paste source code into chat.

The metadata file must contain this structure, with your resolved model slug and date and the fixed integer version 1:

~~~json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "model": "MODEL_SLUG",
  "category": "site-brand",
  "date": "RUN_DATE",
  "version": 1,
  "entry": "index.html",
  "prompt": "01",
  "prompt_label": "Brand & Business Website",
  "notes": "A concise, honest description of the completed project and any known limitations."
}
~~~

Replace both tokens. The folder and metadata must agree exactly. The organiser will ZIP this one folder and upload it to ModelBench. ZIP filenames are not routing keys. Do not include scores or self-awarded evaluations in metadata.

When finished, report only the project folder path and an honest test status.
