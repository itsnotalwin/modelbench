# 14 · Living simulation — benchmark prompt

> **Uploader instruction (do NOT send this header to the model):**
> The model delivers three files. Upload each one as its own `.html` into `inbox/`, renamed to exactly:
> `sim__<model-slug>__<YYYY-MM-DD>__v1.html`, `…__v2.html`, `…__v3.html`
> Never upload a .rar. A retest of this prompt uses v4, v5, v6.

## Model prompt (send everything below this line)

Build **three separate simulations** of systems that evolve: an ecosystem, an economy, a queueing network, a fluid, a chemical reactor, an orbital system — you choose, and each must be a different field with different mathematics. No two may share an integrator, a control layout or a visualisation. Do not ask questions and do not hedge. Decide and build in one pass. Random walks dressed up as physics are the wrong answer.

**Ground rules (apply to all three)**
- Each file is one self-contained HTML file: HTML, CSS and JS inline. No external images, fonts, audio files or model files.
- Each must open directly from disk (`file://`) and work on GitHub Pages from a subfolder. No server, no build step, no install.
- No placeholder text, TODOs, dead controls or unfinished sections.
- Allowed libraries: none. Everything is built with the platform: no CDN scripts, no web fonts, no image or audio files.

**What each file must do**
- 4+ coupled variables where the coupling is the point, with the equations stated on screen.
- Real numerics: a named integrator (RK4, Euler, Verlet), a fixed timestep, and stable behaviour at the extremes. No `x += random()` pretending to be a model.
- 3+ scenarios with different parameters, each with a one-line description of what it demonstrates.
- 3+ live plots (time series, phase portrait, distribution) drawn on canvas with axes and labels.
- Controls: play, pause, single step, speed, reset, and a seed for anything stochastic.
- CSV export of the full run, and a PNG of the plots.
- A self-check that compares the numerical result against a case with a known analytic answer and reports the error on screen.
- A conservation or sanity readout (mass, energy, total population) so a broken run is visible.

**Mobile-first and installable (mandatory, every file)**
- Design for a 390px-wide portrait phone first, then scale up to desktop. Touch is the primary input: every control is at least 44px, nothing depends on hover, and the first interaction works with one thumb.
- Works in portrait and landscape, handles `resize` and `orientationchange`, and respects `env(safe-area-inset-*)` so nothing hides behind a notch or the home bar.
- Fits the screen: use `100dvh`, no accidental page scrolling, and `touch-action` set on interactive canvases so pinch and double-tap do not zoom the page.
- Mobile specifics: plots stack vertically at full width, controls become a bottom bar, and CSV export uses a real download.
- The file must be installable as a Progressive Web App. The benchmark host places `manifest.webmanifest`, `sw.js` and `icons/` next to your file. Your file must reference them. Put exactly these lines in `<head>` (set `theme-color` to your own palette colour):

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#0b0d12">
<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent">
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.webmanifest">
<link rel="icon" href="icons/icon-192.png" sizes="192x192" type="image/png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="icons/icon-192.png">
```

  and this line just before `</body>`:

```html
<script>if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) navigator.serviceWorker.register('sw.js').catch(() => {});</script>
```

- Do not create the manifest, service worker or icon files yourself. The file must still open and work from disk even when they are missing. Once installed, the app must run offline after its first load, so keep runtime network use to the CDN libraries this prompt allows.

**Delivery — naming is mandatory**
- File names are `sim__{model-slug}__{YYYY-MM-DD}__v1.html`, then `…__v2.html`, then `…__v3.html`.
  - `{model-slug}`: your model name in lowercase, hyphens for spaces, dots kept when they are part of the name (for example `glm-5.3-flash`).
  - `{YYYY-MM-DD}`: today's date.
  - No creative file names, no uppercase letters, no spaces.
- Deliver the three files in order. Before each one, write its exact file name on its own line. Then the complete file in one code block.
- After the third file, give one short bullet list per file: the system, the numerics, and one known limitation. Nothing else.
