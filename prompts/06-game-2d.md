## Automatic run identity — Never ask the organiser for these values

Resolve these three values yourself before creating the project. Never ask the organiser or user for MODEL_SLUG, RUN_DATE or VERSION. They are run metadata, not questions or creative choices.

1. **MODEL_SLUG:** Identify the model that is actually executing this prompt from the active system/runtime model identifier. Prefer the exact model identifier, including its variant, when exposed; otherwise use the public model name supplied by the environment. If it is provider-qualified (for example, `provider/model-name`), keep the model portion. Convert it to lowercase and replace spaces, underscores and other characters with hyphens; retain only letters, digits, dots and hyphens, collapse repeated hyphens and remove leading/trailing punctuation. Do not use the benchmark category, prompt title, organiser's name or an assumed model. If the runtime exposes no model identity at all, use `unknown-model` and disclose that limitation briefly in `meta.json` notes rather than inventing an identity.
2. **RUN_DATE:** Use the current calendar date supplied by your system/runtime context, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. If that context does not provide a date, use the current UTC calendar date from the runtime. Do not use the prompt's edit date or a file timestamp.
3. **VERSION:** Always use the integer `1`. This is fixed. Never ask, infer, increment or substitute another version.

Use the resolved values consistently in the output folder and `meta.json`. Do not pause for confirmation and do not leave literal placeholders in the finished files.

## The challenge

Design and build one complete original 2D puzzle game. You decide the premise, setting, visual style, tone, player role, rules, puzzle mechanic, level structure and progression. The mechanic should be understandable, offer room for mastery and produce interesting decisions. Do not imitate an existing game's levels, characters, branding or presentation.

## What the build must deliver

1. Invent a central puzzle mechanic and teach it clearly through the opening interaction. The player should understand what actions are available and why they matter.
2. Create at least six designed, solvable stages or challenges with a deliberate difficulty curve. Avoid relying on random layouts that may be impossible to solve.
3. Implement reliable game state, collision or rule resolution, win detection and clear feedback for successful and invalid actions.
4. Provide restart and undo or another fair recovery mechanism. Add hints only if they support the design without solving the game automatically.
5. Support keyboard and touch input with clear controls. Include complete title, playing, pause where appropriate, stage-complete and game-complete states.
6. Save meaningful progress locally and restore it safely after reload.

## Quality bar

Make the result feel like a finished, intentionally designed product. Make strong creative and technical decisions independently; do not ask the organiser to choose the concept, visual direction, content, mechanics or implementation. Use a distinctive identity and a consistent visual language. Prioritise clarity, responsiveness, satisfying interaction and meaningful detail over decorative complexity.

Every visible control must work. Every important interaction must create a real state change and give appropriate feedback. Avoid placeholder sections, dead buttons, fake charts, non-functional menus, empty world geometry and features that only look interactive. A smaller coherent experience is better than a large collection of unfinished systems.

## Acceptance checklist

- [ ] The game has an original, understandable puzzle mechanic.
- [ ] At least six stages are playable and can be completed.
- [ ] Rules, state changes, invalid moves and completion are communicated clearly.
- [ ] Undo/restart or equivalent recovery works reliably.
- [ ] Keyboard and touch controls are both usable.
- [ ] Progress persists and the game remains responsive at common screen sizes.

## Technical expectations

- Deliver a browser-first project that runs from its index.html entry point on a static host. Use an appropriate client-side implementation and include only dependencies that are genuinely needed.
- Do not require a backend, private API, secret key, build service or manual setup to demonstrate the core experience.
- Handle browser storage, invalid input, empty states, errors and reloads deliberately wherever relevant to the product.
- Use semantic structure, accessible labels, visible keyboard focus, sensible contrast, keyboard support and reduced-motion preferences.
- Make the experience responsive. Do not sacrifice core usability on smaller screens.
- Test the actual experience in a browser when possible. If browser testing is unavailable, perform a careful code-level smoke check and report that limitation honestly.
- Do not claim that something was tested unless it was actually tested.

## Submission contract — mandatory

Create exactly one folder at the workspace root named:

**game-2d__MODEL_SLUG__RUN_DATE__v1**

Before creating it, replace `MODEL_SLUG` and `RUN_DATE` using the automatic run-identity rules above. The suffix must always be `v1`.

At the folder root include **index.html** and **meta.json**. Include an **assets/** folder only for essential local runtime assets. Keep all files for this one finished project inside this folder.

Do not create multiple concepts, alternate versions, separate projects, additional HTML pages, README or audit files, screenshots, dependency folders, package files or build output. Do not create files outside the required project folder. Do not paste source code into chat.

The metadata file must contain this structure with the exact automatically resolved model slug and date. Keep `version` as the JSON number `1`:

~~~json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "model": "MODEL_SLUG",
  "category": "game-2d",
  "date": "RUN_DATE",
  "version": 1,
  "entry": "index.html",
  "prompt": "06",
  "prompt_label": "2D Puzzle Game",
  "notes": "One or two honest sentences describing the completed build and any known limitations."
}
~~~

Replace the two metadata tokens with the values you resolved yourself. Do not ask the organiser for them and do not submit unresolved placeholder text. The folder and metadata must agree exactly. The organiser will ZIP this one folder and upload it to ModelBench. The ZIP filename is not a routing key. Do not include scores or self-awarded evaluations in `meta.json`.

When finished, report only the project folder path and an honest test status.
