# 11 · Music machine — benchmark prompt

> **Uploader instruction (do NOT send this header to the model):**
> The model delivers three files. Upload each one as its own `.html` into `inbox/`, renamed to exactly:
> `music__<model-slug>__<YYYY-MM-DD>__v1.html`, `…__v2.html`, `…__v3.html`
> Never upload a .rar. A retest of this prompt uses v4, v5, v6.

## Model prompt (send everything below this line)

Build **three separate music machines** — an instrument, a sequencer, a generative piece, or something else that makes sound — each played and heard in the browser. Each is a different way of making music, and no two may share a voice architecture or a control surface. You choose the instrument, the tuning and the sound. Do not ask questions and do not hedge. Decide and build in one pass. A grid of beeps with no mix is the wrong answer.

**Ground rules (apply to all three)**
- Each file is one self-contained HTML file: HTML, CSS and JS inline. No external images, fonts, audio files or model files.
- Each must open directly from disk (`file://`) and work on GitHub Pages from a subfolder. No server, no build step, no install.
- No placeholder text, TODOs, dead controls or unfinished sections.
- Allowed libraries: none. Everything is built with the platform: no CDN scripts, no web fonts, no image or audio files.

**What each file must do**
- It must sound intentional within ten seconds of pressing play.
- 8+ voices or tracks, each synthesised with Web Audio (oscillators, noise, filters, envelopes). No sample files.
- A quantised clock that does not drift: schedule on the audio clock, not `setInterval`, and keep the visuals in sync.
- 3+ scales or modes, tempo, swing, and per-voice mute and solo.
- Visual feedback that is part of the instrument: each voice shows its own activity and the playhead is readable at a glance.
- Pattern save and load as JSON (download and paste-in), plus a 30–60 second render to WAV through `OfflineAudioContext`.
- A mix that is not painful: master gain, no clipping, a limiter or soft clip, and a panic button that silences everything.
- Touch-first: pads at least 56px, nothing hover-only, and audio starts only after a user gesture.

**Mobile-first and installable (mandatory, every file)**
- Design for a 390px-wide portrait phone first, then scale up to desktop. Touch is the primary input: every control is at least 44px, nothing depends on hover, and the first interaction works with one thumb.
- Works in portrait and landscape, handles `resize` and `orientationchange`, and respects `env(safe-area-inset-*)` so nothing hides behind a notch or the home bar.
- Fits the screen: use `100dvh`, no accidental page scrolling, and `touch-action` set on interactive canvases so pinch and double-tap do not zoom the page.
- Mobile specifics: pads and steps at least 56px, a horizontally scrollable step grid with a readable playhead, and no hover-only controls.
- The file must be installable as a Progressive Web App. The benchmark host places `manifest.webmanifest`, `sw.js` and `icons/` next to your file. Your file must reference them. Put exactly these lines in `<head>` (set `theme-color` to your own palette colour):

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#0b0d12">
<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent">
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.webmanifest">
<link rel="icon" href="icons/icon-192.png" sizes="192x192" type="image/png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="icons/icon-192.png">
```

  and this line just before `</body>`:

```html
<script>if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) navigator.serviceWorker.register('sw.js').catch(() => {});</script>
```

- Do not create the manifest, service worker or icon files yourself. The file must still open and work from disk even when they are missing. Once installed, the app must run offline after its first load, so keep runtime network use to the CDN libraries this prompt allows.

**Delivery — naming is mandatory**
- File names are `music__{model-slug}__{YYYY-MM-DD}__v1.html`, then `…__v2.html`, then `…__v3.html`.
  - `{model-slug}`: your model name in lowercase, hyphens for spaces, dots kept when they are part of the name (for example `glm-5.3-flash`).
  - `{YYYY-MM-DD}`: today's date.
  - No creative file names, no uppercase letters, no spaces.
- Deliver the three files in order. Before each one, write its exact file name on its own line. Then the complete file in one code block.
- After the third file, give one short bullet list per file: the instrument, its voice design, and one known limitation. Nothing else.
